# material-analyzer
A personal Python project to explore programming concepts through data analysis, visualization, and material science tools.I'm currently working on it, but when finished it will be a tool that allows users to search, store, and analyze materials based on their properties. It will also include basic tools for visualizing data and working with X-ray diffraction (XRD) results â€” designed to blend science with code. The goal is also to implement a smart chatbot, using LangChain to search from pdfs (Books related to material science, nanotechnology and solid state physics) and answer based on key words from the question.

# About the Project:
This is a personal learning project by a junior developer with a Physics background. It aims to bring together:
- Programming in **Python**
- Scientific problem-solving
- Data storage and visualization
- Real-world use cases like material analysis

## Features:
- **Search materials** by name, type, or properties  
- **Add new materials** to a local database (currently on text files)  
- **View data visually** with simple graphs  
- **Analyze XRD patterns** (experimental feature)  
- Simple **files** for data
- Smart **Chatbot** to make learning and answearing questions easier 

## Technologies Used:

- Python 3  
- Matplotlib / Plotly (for graphs)   
- Custom classes for material properties
- LangChain for chatbot

## Goals:

- Practice OOP in Python  
- Learn how to structure a larger project  
- Explore science + software combinations  
- Build tools that support scientific analysis

## ðŸ“š How to Run

1. Clone the repo  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/material-explorer.git
   cd material-explorer
